# Predicting Covid-19 For Better Healthcare

Description: Our project focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-
19 based on observed symptoms. Aim to develop highly accurate algorithms capable of reliably determining
whether an individual has COVID-19. The goal is to contribute to improved diagnostic capabilities,
facilitating the efficient management of healthcare resources during this global health crisis.
**Tools and Technologies Used:** Python tools like Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sci-kit
learn.MySQL for targeted data extraction from the cleaned dataset.
